# Brickify

It's a bunch of projects that were developed for a learning purposes. The problem that
the project tries to solve is: find a way to use controlled REACT components for WYSIWYG
functionality.

For now it's only about WYSIWYG editor and the corresponding areas: inline text
formatting, exporting JSON for the current dom, handling the updates in a controlled way,
etc.

In addition this project tries to use functional programming practices.

We use [React](https://react.dev/) components and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) server
for serving examples.

## Useful links

- [ReactJs](https://react.dev/). The core library for this is reactjs.
- [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/). I decided to use fp-ts since it's good enough
  in typescript and easy to use.
